# MNIST CNN Classifier

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The CNN model consists of convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and dense layers, optimized for digit recognition.

## Project Structure
- **Model**: A CNN model built and trained on the MNIST dataset.
- **Training**: The model is trained for 10 epochs and evaluated on the test set.
- **Results**: Achieved ~98.91% accuracy on the test set.

## Requirements
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage
Simply run the code to train and evaluate the CNN model on the MNIST dataset.
